Hello everyone, welcome to the Agent Assemble Challenge. This is a quick start
guide to help you get started on the competition. So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to walk you through the steps that you will need to complete to start
building your application or your agent. I'm going to go first to app.promptopinion.ai
and I'm going to click on sign up and I'm going to fill in some details in here.
After you have filled in the details, click on the create button and at this
point what you need to do is select a model. So to get you started what you can
do is you can use Google AI Studio. So you can actually click on this link to go
to AI Studio. You just need a Gmail account to get an AI Studio account and you
can go down here, click on get API key and then create a new API key and then
create the key which will create a new API key for you and from there you can
actually copy this key. I'm going to copy that key and come back in here, click
on load models and what we recommend for the Connectathon is to use the Gemini
3.1 Flash Lite. So I will go back in here. This one again you can choose a
different one. I'll just give it a quick name and then what I can do is add the
model. So with that your initial setup is completed and you are ready to
start creating your first agent. So to get started what you can do is you can
just click on this configure an agent and turn on this agent which is available
by default which is a general chat agent. This is not the agent that you will be
submitting for the competition but you can use that for various testing
scenarios. The next thing you would want to do is basically have some patience in
your system. So what we give you is you have different options. You can import
some synthetic patients or you can upload your own fire bundle or the simplest
ways that you can actually go in here and we have a couple of patients you know
loaded so I can just go in there and individually select a patient that will
basically import some basic demographics and other data and we are building on
some more samples that we will be sharing. You could also manually add a
patient and then one of the things that definitely recommend is that after you
have added the patient what you want to do is you basically want to go to the
patient and upload some documents clinical notes or something because most
of the scenarios that we are working with are around generative AI exploring
clinical notes. So everyone will have a different scenario but anything that
works for your use case upload those documents or any other data you want to
kind of load for that patient. So I'm going to do that here quickly.
Once that is done I am basically ready to start creating my application for you
know for the competition. So what are we going to do is we are going to go through
three different scenarios so that you have so you can basically apply for any
one of them or you can submit multiple applications and I'm going to go through
each one of them. The first use case basically involves no code at all so
you can actually build an agent within prompt opinion workspace and publish it
as what is known as A to A. What we are going to do in this scenario is that we
are going to upload some sample policy documents of an organization and we'll
show how the agent basically responds based on those policy documents. Again
the idea here is to show you an example of what can be done without any coding
within the system and then you can basically build something accordingly
based on the different scenarios that you're working on. So what I'll do is
I'm going to go back to prompt opinion and I'm going to go to configuration. I'm
going to go to these collections and I'm going to create a new collection in
here and I'll just call it my org policies and then what I'm going to do is
I'm going to go ahead and upload some documents to it. These are just some
policies that I've created locally that I can upload it in here. So let me do that.
Once I've uploaded these policies I'm ready to basically build my first agent.
So for that what I can do is I'll go to the agents tab to the build your own
agents and I'm going to say that I'm going to configure my first agent in
here. So I'm going to click on that agent. So what I'm going to be doing is I'm
going to select patient in here because we will be testing this agent in the
context of a patient and I'll give it some name and description and then what I
will do is I will basically say that this agent is going to use all its
grounding from the folder that we created. So that way all its answers will be
grounded in those policies only. We do let you overwrite the system prompt for
the agents but if you don't put any system prompt in here the agents are
configured to by default use the content that it has been given to them. We will
look at some of the other options in here but the last option I need to do
for this is go to this A to A and enable this because this is how we will be
testing this particular agent responding to another agent's request of you know
with the organization policies. So once I do that I also have the choice to
enable the fire context. What that means is that if I want my agent to be
able to actually query for the patient data I can actually select this. We'll
talk about how this happens in some of the advanced scenarios when you're
writing code. When you are building an agent within prompt opinion this is all
taken care of you but if you need that you can just turn it on here and then
the last thing is I need to basically define a skill. So skill in this case is
very similar to you know what this agent can do. So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to put a quick name and description in here and once I have done that I can
go ahead and save this. So with that my first agent is basically configured. Now
again you will basically come up with scenarios that you feel are good for
this particular scenarios but to test this agent what I can do is I can go
back to my launch pad. I'm going to select my patient socope here because I'm
going to test this as a patient. I'm going to select a patient and then what I
want to do is I want to select the general chart not the one that the agent
I built because we are going to show how it actually works in an A2A scenario. So
I'm going to select that particular agent and the first thing I can do is I can
just chat with it something like summarize this patient. So this will
basically go and give me summary of the patient but then to test my agent that I
have built what I can do is I can say I want to consult with that agent and I
will give it a prompt something like
so so basically what you'll see is that when I ask that question that particular
agent connected to the new agent that we had created it was able to read the
documents that I have uploaded to it checked with the patient's conditions
and then responded based on that what I can you know what I needed to. So again
this is the very simple scenario of how you can build content based grounded
agents within the prompt opinion framework as one of the options for
submitting your to your competition. So I'm going to go back to my drawing so
this was option one where you basically configured this agent within prompt
opinion it can be with you know with basically content with some other system
prompts however you want to configure it and now we are going to go to the second
scenario where we want to build an MCP server. So for the MCP server the way it
works is that you will be building a set of tools these could be any tools that
use the patient data and then return some you know responses back to the user
agent that will be developed and what we will also do is we can basically pass
the fire context to it where the MCP server will return receive a token that
can use to get that data. So don't worry if it sounds complicated because what we
have done is we have actually built some default repositories that you can use as
a starting point. So for the MCP server you will be using this Spoke Community
MCP and what I have is I've actually downloaded that repository to my local
location so that I can run it from here and I can show you how you will be
using it to test it but then you will be building your own tools in this to
submit for your entry and we have what we have done is we have basically built a
couple of very basic tools that I'll show you but that will give you ideas to
get started on your own tools. Okay so I already have this tool running on a local
host but obviously to test with your application you will need to make it
available through the internet. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to actually
use ngrock and I'm going to create a port to map it to this particular port.
So once I have ngrock running and I have copied the port I can go back to my
application and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to my workspace
hub and I'm going to add the new MCP server that we just added here so what I
need to do is just copy the URL this is my ngrock URL and then forward slash
MCP I'll give it a name my MCP streamable HTTP we don't have any
authentication built on it by default so you can obviously you know customize it
and put keys in there and then the important thing here is that I'm going
to check this box this is the box that will tell that you know hey I need to
pass in the token using which then that MCP server can actually make fire
calls back to the fire server and you know kind of return some data and other
things and again all of this code is available in the repo in .NET or in
TypeScript so we have both the samples in that repo that you can see so I'm just
going to go back in here and click first of all I'll just make tests to make
sure and you can see that it is returning these two tools they're very
simple tools that just return a patient age but that will give you ideas to get
started and I'm just going to click on save now to test the MCP server what I
can do is I can go back to the custom agent that I had created and I'm going
to go into the edit there and what I'm going to say is that I want to actually
use a tool in that particular sorry I'm going to use a tool within that
particular agent and if I click on add it will give me the tools that are in my
system and then I can select that tool and save it so once I have this done I
can go back to the launchpad and again go same way select a patient but this
time I'm actually going to select this agent because what I'm trying to demo is
the MCP server so I'm going to select there and then what I'm going to go
here and just say this is like
I'm just going to ask a question to get the patient age and what you can see is
that it returned me a response but the way to check that it actually called the
tool is that you can actually turn this on and you will see that the call was
made to that particular tool if I had put a break point in here I would have
seen it but I could actually go down the path and see that the call was made to
this and that's kind of how it you know work so again this was scenario number
two so in this case we built an MCP server and we have added that MCP server
and made that available so that it can be tested from an agent within the
prompt opinion workspace again this server this repository is to give you
something to start with you can add as many tools as many fire calls to kind
of get that going I will also just remind here is if I didn't before that when
you create the workspace within prompt opinion it is actually a fire server so
you can pretty much make any fire server calls from that MCP server which will be
kind of being made to your workspace so the last option again what we have is
in here is what we are going to do is to build a completely independent A2A
agent so this is where if you have a scenario where you are building an
agent using Google ADK or anything but the agent can support A2A yourself then
this is the option that you can build and then publish that agent again to get
you started with that what we have done is we have published two repositories
both of them are based on Google ADK they were actually vibe coded from Google
ADK one is in Python and one is in TypeScript and depending on again your
preference you can download each one of them and you can see which one you know
helps you and then based on that you can customize them for the scenarios that
you are working on I have already them downloaded in here and again if you will
go into the code of that so let me just close off these latest changes it has
all the steps to get started the main thing I'm going to go in here so the
readme file you can actually see how to go get started but what I have done is
I have already kind of running it so this actually has three built-in agents
we are only be going to using one of them which is on running on port 8001 and
that's the one that we will use to test it now before we test this there's a
couple of things that we need to do first is obviously we need to kind of put
our ngrock to this particular server so let me do that really quickly so I'm
going to stop that my current ngrock server and then I'm going to basically
point it towards 8081 I think that's the server which is where the server is
running or it is actually 8001 sorry okay so and what then I also need to do is
that I need to basically copy this particular URL and then I need to go in
there and copy this URL back into my environment variable because when the
agent card is submitted it needs to kind of know where the where the agent is
running and it kind of needs to pick it up from there once I've done that I will
need to restart the application once if I already have it running so let me do
that really quickly here okay so the application is running again and it's
basically picked up that port so now what I can do is I will go back to my
application and now we are going to actually connect an external agent so
again what I'll do is I will go back to my workspace hub but this time I'm
basically connecting an external agent and I'm going to go and say add
connection and I'm going to paste the URL that is basically for that ngrock
URL and then I can click on check what it will do at this point it is basically
connecting to that particular agent and it's pulling the card of that agent I
can see that I have the skills other things that are available from that agent
so I'm going to give it a name to say my external agent just to kind of get
started and then the thing is that in this case we are actually you know it's
telling me that this agent requires a key so we did this on purpose again while
testing you can adjust it but because this agent will have your Gemini key or
whatever you're using the model so we have a security kind of sample built in
there but the way it is very simple if I go into the middleware I can just copy
that key from there and bring it here and just paste it here the other thing is
that this agent will warn you that you know this agent requires fire context
so just like the mcp server we can actually pass fire context to the agent
to and the agent can actually then you know get the fire data directly and make
calls so I'm going to say yes I do want to do that and then I'm going to just
save there to you know add that agent to my workspace so at this point again the
you will be customizing your own agent but I have added that agent and that
agent is available within my workspace so there's one last thing left to test
this agent with one of my own agents so again I'm going to go back to the
launchpad and I'm going to just select the same patient we have been selecting
I'm just going to select the general agent because again we are testing an
external agent this is how the judges will be testing it to and what I'm
going to do is I'm just going to select that external agent in here and just
again as an example I will just say ask the
and again this is a very very basic you know come on to show you kind of how the
communication and the exchange happens obviously based on your own you know
agent scenarios this will be a lot more data but what you're seeing in here is
that I basically ask the demographics this our agent made a call to the
external agent the external agent pulled that data directly from the fire
returned that data and then our agent has summarized this so this is how you
can actually go into this particular agent and customize it and build
different a to a scenarios for health care and then bring them all together so
this was a very quick overview of what are the T different ways you can
basically submit an agent or an mcp server for your application as once
you have done once you have built your agents or an mcp server and you have
tested it there will be one additional step that you will have to do and we
will be building a detailed video on that too but what it basically will be
is like any of these agents need to be published so that they can be tested by
the judges and you know for all the different scenarios and the way you
will do that is you will just go to this marketplace studio at the bottom and
depending on if you are submitting an mcp server or an agent you will just go
in here and you can basically add the way you added your mcp servers in here
and you can publish them from here this step will be needed before the judging
starts we will be doing a lot of office hours and other discussions before
that so for now you can basically start testing your agents and contact us on
discord if you have any other issues and we'll go from there thanks so much
for listening bye
